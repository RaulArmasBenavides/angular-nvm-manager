# 🧰 Angular NVM Manager

A lightweight and cross-compatible console app that helps you quickly switch Node.js versions and install the correct Angular CLI version for each project or client.

Ideal for developers who work across multiple Angular projects that require different Node/NPM/Angular CLI setups.

- 🚀 Interactive terminal menu
- 🔄 Automatically switches Node.js version using `nvm`

You can extend projects.json with more fields if needed.

Use a .nvmrc file per project if you want deeper integration.

Works great as a pre-setup script before opening Angular projects in VS Code.
